  description: "Welcome home,\n\nI hope you had a good time studying abroad, we've
    all missed you dearly. I'm sure you'll notice there have been some changes around
    here; I do apologise. I simply cannot wait to see you again and catch up, but
    say, shall we play a little game first? You see, I need your help with something,
    my old brain isn't what it used to be, and I've found myself doubting my capabilities
    lately. \n\nYou've always been so intelligent, would you be so kind as to help
    me with my research? I just need to make sure I've come to the right conclusions.
    \n\nOh, but it would be rude of me to ask for your help without anything in return,
    so I've prepared some puzzles for you. You always loved those. Don't think about
    it too much, just have a look around the house, I'll check in with you periodically.\n\n-
    Dad"
