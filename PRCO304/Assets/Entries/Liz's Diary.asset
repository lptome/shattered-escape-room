  description: Dad's been acting up lately. Last night he insisted- no, he *demanded*
    that mum cook an entire chicken for dinner. He also spends all day locked in
    his room going over notes from his trip. Does he know about our secret? I told
    mum I was going to tell him, but she said I should keep my mouth shut, if I know
    what's good for me.
